## Introduction
  - The purpose of this project was to allow students to practice some of the foundational concepts learned so far within the module. There are other extensions that test different skills that we can build on. The project allowed us to personalize/entertain different ideas with HTML/CSS as well as the functionality(JavaScript) behind the web page created.
## Technologies
  - Javascript
  - HTML
  - CSS
## Illustrations
  ![Saved Palettes](assets/colorandom-savedpalettes.png)
## Features
- Added a scroll feature to allow the user to save as many palettes as they wish in the Saved Palettes section.
## Deployed Page
Visit our published Hang In There Site! [here](https://forsethnico.github.io/random-colors/)
## Possible Future Extensions
  - Ensure all saved palettes are unique and allow the user to add a name to each saved palette.
  - Research hex codes to figure out how to programmatically generate random palettes that are cohesive and pleasant as currently it is generating colors completely at random. 
## Set Up
To begin, choose ONE TEAM MEMBER to do the following:
Locally, create a new folder containing an empty index.html file, a blank scripts.js file, and an empty styles.css file.
Run git init in your terminal (make sure your working directory is your project folder).
Create an initial commit.
On GitHub, create a new repository. Follow the written instructions on GitHub to add the repoâ€™s remote to your local project, and push your initial commit up to GitHub.
